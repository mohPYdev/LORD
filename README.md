# Project Title

This project is an online panel for generating reservation/booking websites with lots of features to customize.
We devided the reservation items into 3 groups:
 - Places 
    - eg. Cinema, Restaurant, Stadium
 - People 
    - eg. Doctor, Professor
 - Resources
    - eg. Sporting goods, Renting Cars

So you can choose the best customization according to the type of item you want people to book.



## How to Use?

If you want to send emails after reservation or send email to reset user's passwords you should do the following:
 1. Create a gmail account
 2. Click on the little dotted square in the top right corner

 3. Locate security section and enable 2-step verification
 4. Follow the steps of "How to generate an App password" and recieve a random password.
 5. When generating the system, type the given password and email address into the fields.
 
 !important note: DO NOT TYPE YOUR ORIGINAL GMAIL PASSWORD INTO THE PASSWORD FIELD.
 
after setting up your admin email, you can generate the system with the option that you want. The generation is quite streight forward.

!note: In the attributes section (section 4), you should choose a name if your item is either a resource or a place or you should choose first_name and last_name for your item!
